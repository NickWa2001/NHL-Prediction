# NHL-Prediction
Website to predict standings for the 2024-2025 season.

In this website, you are able to predict the standings of each team, separated by division and conference.

Scores are golf-style; Everyone starts with a perfect score of 0. After you've locked in your predictions, and teams move up or down from your guesses, you will lose points based on how far they've moved.

Each movement up or down is one point. If a team goes from eighth in your prediction to first, they went up by seven spots, so you gain seven points. Of course, this also means that other teams were displaced by the movement, so you will gain points for that too (gaining points is bad)
